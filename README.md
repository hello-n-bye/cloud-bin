## Using the API

* Ever wanted to create a new file with Cloudbin programmatically? Here's how you can do it using Python! 🐍

```python
import requests

# Define the content you want to share
code_content = "hello, from CloudBin api!"

# Set the URL to Cloudbin's script endpoint
url = 'https://new-cloudbin.koyeb.app/scripts'

# Specify the content type as plain text
headers = {
  'Content-Type': 'text/plain'
}

# Send a POST request to create a new file
response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, data=code_content)

# Check if the request was successful
if response.status_code == 200:
  try:
    response_text = response.content.decode('utf-8')

    # If it succeeds
    print(f"File made @ https://new-cloudbin.koyeb.app/scripts/{response_text}
  except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error decoding response content: {e}")
else:
  print(f"Error: {response.status_code} - {response.text}")
```


This code snippet will create a new file with the text "hello, from CloudBin api!" and print the URL to access the file.
